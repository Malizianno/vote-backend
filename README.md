# vot.e App

vot.e App is designed to be a three-part app known as microservice architecture as follows:

1. vot.e backend -> The core app which stores the data and executes voting processes (simulations)
2. vot.e frontend -> The ADMIN user interface, accessible only via ADMIN accounts
3. vot.e mobile app -> The mobile App

## vot.e backend

This app stores the data, collected via the mobile app at account creation and data collected via the admin UI when using the voting mechanism;
The data is stored in a MySQL database, installed on a RaspberryPi found at ip (check application.properties).
